- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnthonyRyba, totally NEW to the world of coding and programming so I may make use of the wrong terminology throughout my comments. 
      You could say that this is my second Career.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all about computer coding and programming with a view towards operating as a Full Stack Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, SCSS, nodeJs and Salesforce Developer Tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at this stage, but as soon as I feel I am of added value I will ammend this profile, moving forward
- 📫 How to reach me ...TBA
